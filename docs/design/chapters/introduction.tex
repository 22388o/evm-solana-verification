\chapter{Introduction}

This document is a technical reference to the in-EVM Solana's 'Light-Client'
state verification project.

\section{Overview}

The project's purpose is to provide Ethereum users with reliable Solana's
cluster state and necessary transactions proof.

The project UX consists of several steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Retrieve Solana's 'Light-Client' state.
    \item Generate a proof for it.
    \item Submit the proof to EVM-enabled cluster.
    \item Verify the proof with EVM.
\end{enumerate}

Such a UX defines projects parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Solana's 'Light-Client' state retriever.
    \item State proof generator.
    \item Ethereum RPC proof submitter.
    \item EVM-based proof verificator.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these parts will be considered independently.
